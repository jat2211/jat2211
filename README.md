# Hi there, I'm Jay Trevino!
## What do I value?
In my quest to navigate the ever-evolving digital landscape, I approach it all with an open mind, like an intrepid explorer venturing into uncharted territories. I'm not content with staying confined to a single fieldâ€”I cast my net wide, diving into research across various domains. From unraveling the mysteries of the cosmos to championing human rights, I relish the opportunity to delve into diverse subjects. A modern-day generalist, if you will.

You see, the world around us is changing at breakneck speed, and I've come to realize that adaptability is the name of the game. To stay ahead of the curve, I cultivate a flexible skill set that defies categorization. This approach not only makes me a hot commodity in the professional realm but also enriches my personal life. Think of it as being a chameleon, seamlessly adapting to different environments, blending in effortlessly.

But that's not all there is to me. My interests span far and wide, reflecting the kaleidoscope of my personality. I've honed my talents behind the lens, capturing moments frozen in time through my photography and videography pursuits. And when I'm not immersed in pixels and frames, I'm busy orchestrating complex melodies as a music producer. My fingers, classically-trained in the arts of piano and electric bass, now dance across the keys and strings, giving life to my creative visions.

Sports, too, have been an integral part of my journey. For over 15 years, I've taken to the hardwood, battling it out on the basketball court with a fierce determination. But it doesn't stop there. I've embraced the harmony of mind and body, indulging in weekly yoga sessions that soothe the soul. And if that's not enough to satisfy my hunger for challenges, I'm currently gearing up for a marathon, pushing my physical limits and embracing the euphoria that comes with surpassing them.

You see, I come from humble beginnings, where financial struggles were the norm. As a first-generation college student who recently graduated from an esteemed Ivy League institution, I'm driven by an unyielding desire to shatter barriers. The boundaries that society tries to confine us within are mere illusions to me, fueling my ambition to push beyond what is expected, to break free from the chains of the past.

I am, above all, a lifelong learner. A seeker of knowledge, experience, and growth. Every venture I undertake is an opportunity to stretch my wings and soar to new heights. With an insatiable thirst for discovery and a flair for embracing the unknown, I embark on this journey, weaving together the threads of my multidimensional existence. Casual, yet resolute. A narrative that could grace the pages of a captivating book or find its place in the bold strokes of an op-ed, capturing hearts and minds alike.

## What is my journey?
- **Aug 2020 - Feb 2021:** For six months I gazed at the cosmos through the lens of mathematical derivations and supercomputers doing cosmology research on Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB).
- **Jun 2021 - Aug 2021:** For a summer, I researched galaxies, ate tacos, and dove headfirst into everything data science had to offer. I also operated one of the largest telescopes in the world.
- **Sep 2021 - May 2022:** I worked at a mock startup, having the opportunity to explore NLP in practical settings and the creative freedom to make machine learning models how I saw fit.
- **Oct 2021 - Mar 2023:** My largest project(s) to date, I used NLP in human rights research in every aspect of the data pipeline, from collecting and translating Korean financial documents, manipulating data in every which way possible, waiting days for my work to process (and then a few more when it didn't), giving presentations, and writing a 10-page report.
- **May 2022 - Aug 2022:** I went to sunny California as a data analyst intern, played ping pong, hiked a lot, and made over 50 graphs that could (and should) save that company A LOT of money.

- ðŸ“« **How to reach me:** Send a pigeon to New York to join its comrades (and find me somewhere in Manhattan) or find my email somewhere on this page.
