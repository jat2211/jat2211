### Hi there, I'm Jay! 👋

- 🔭 I recently completed an astronomy research internship modeling galaxies. All of my work can be found right [here](https://github.com/jat2211/Photoionization-Modeling).
- 💸 Right now, I'm fighting for the people using [NLP](https://github.com/jat2211/data-for-good) to find human rights violations by companies in financial data!
- 📝 I just finished working as a ☁️CloudOps Data Analyst☁️ at Workday, Inc.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any data science projects so shoot me an email at jay.trevino@columbia.edu!
- 📽️ If it's a horror movie, I've probably seen it.
- 📫 How to reach me: Send a pigeon or find my email somewhere on this page.
