### Hi there, I'm Jay! 👋
## What do I value?
I believe that life is an ongoing process of exploration, learning, and personal growth. By using data science and programming as tools, I seek to deepen my understanding of the world and myself, and to expand my horizons through new experiences and insights. I strive to cultivate a curious, open-minded, and analytical approach to life, and to use the knowledge and skills I gain to make positive contributions to the world around me. By constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities, and by approaching them with a spirit of creativity, collaboration, and determination, I can lead a rich and fulfilling life that is both intellectually and emotionally rewarding."

## What is my journey?
- 🔭 I recently completed an astronomy research internship modeling galaxies. All of my work can be found right [here](https://github.com/jat2211/Photoionization-Modeling).
- 💸 Right now, I'm fighting for the people using [NLP](https://github.com/jat2211/data-for-good) to find human rights violations by companies in financial data!
- 📝 I just finished working as a ☁️CloudOps Data Analyst☁️ at Workday, Inc.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any data science projects so shoot me an email at jay.trevino@columbia.edu!
- 📽️ If it's a horror movie, I've probably seen it.
- 📫 How to reach me: Send a pigeon or find my email somewhere on this page.
