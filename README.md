# Hi there, I'm Jay Trevino!
## What do I value?
Iâ€™ve always approached the digital world with curiosity and an open mind, constantly exploring different fields rather than sticking to one. My research spans across various domainsâ€”from studying the cosmos to working on human rights projectsâ€”because I enjoy diving into new challenges and learning something different every time. You could call me a generalist, but Iâ€™m more focused on adapting to whatâ€™s next than staying in one lane.

The pace of change today is fast, and Iâ€™ve learned that adaptability is key. By keeping my skill set broad, Iâ€™m able to shift between different areas with ease, whether thatâ€™s in my professional work or personal projects. It's like blending into new environments without missing a beat.

Beyond work, I have a wide range of interests that reflect different parts of who I am. Iâ€™m passionate about photography and videography, capturing moments through a lens. Music production is another creative outlet for me, where my background in piano and electric bass shapes the sounds I create.

Iâ€™ve been playing basketball for over 15 years, and physical challenges have always been part of my life. Yoga keeps me grounded, and I completed a marathon this past January, which pushes me to test my limits both mentally and physically.

Coming from a low-income background as a first-generation college graduate, Iâ€™m driven by the desire to break down barriers and defy expectations. I donâ€™t let circumstances define me, and Iâ€™m always seeking to grow beyond the limitations others might expect.

At the core, Iâ€™m a lifelong learner, always looking for new experiences and ways to grow. Each opportunity, whether big or small, is a chance for me to evolve and discover something new. My journey is about staying curious, embracing challenges, and moving forward with a sense of purpose.

## What is my journey?
- **Aug 2020 - Feb 2021:** For six months I gazed at the cosmos through the lens of mathematical derivations and supercomputers doing cosmology research on Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB).
- **Jun 2021 - Aug 2021:** For a summer, I researched galaxies, ate tacos, and dove headfirst into everything data science had to offer. I also operated one of the largest telescopes in the world.
- **Sep 2021 - May 2022:** I worked at a mock startup, having the opportunity to explore NLP in practical settings and the creative freedom to make machine learning models how I saw fit.
- **Oct 2021 - Mar 2023:** My largest project(s) to date, I used NLP in human rights research in every aspect of the data pipeline, from collecting and translating Korean financial documents, manipulating data in every which way possible, waiting days for my work to process (and then a few more when it didn't), giving presentations, and writing a 10-page report.
- **May 2022 - Aug 2022:** I went to sunny California as a data analyst intern, played ping pong, hiked a lot, and made over 50 graphs that could (and should) save that company A LOT of money.
