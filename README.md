### Hi there, I'm Jay! 👋

- 🎨 I’m currently working on my "on the side" machine learning art projects. Check out some prelimary work [here](https://github.com/jat2211/Warhol-and-Convolutional-Neural-Network)!
- 🔭 I recently completed an astronomy research internship modeling galaxies. All of my work can be found right [here](https://github.com/jat2211/Photoionization-Modeling).
- 💸 Right now, I'm [fighting](https://github.com/jat2211/data-for-good) capitalism (sort of😥) using NLP to find human rights violations by companies in 10-Ks and also work as a data engineer at a startup!

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any data science projects so shoot me an email at jay.trevino@columbia.edu!
- 📽️ Spark up a conversation with me about movies! I love everything from horror to rom-com to horror rom-coms.
