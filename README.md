# Hi there, I'm Jay!
## Me
Iâ€™ve always approached the digital world with curiosity and an open mind, constantly exploring different fields rather than sticking to one. My research spans across various domainsâ€”from studying the cosmos to working on human rights projectsâ€”because I enjoy diving into new challenges and learning something different every time. You could call me a generalist, but Iâ€™m more focused on adapting to whatâ€™s next than staying in one lane.

The pace of change today is fast, and Iâ€™ve learned that adaptability is key. By keeping my skill set broad, Iâ€™m able to shift between different areas with ease, whether thatâ€™s in my professional work or personal projects. It's like blending into new environments without missing a beat.

Beyond work, I have a wide range of interests that reflect different parts of who I am. Iâ€™m passionate about photography and videography, capturing moments through a lens. Music production is another creative outlet for me, where my background in piano and electric bass shapes the sounds I create.

Iâ€™ve been playing basketball for over 15 years, and physical challenges have always been part of my life. Yoga keeps me grounded, and I completed a marathon this past January, which pushes me to test my limits both mentally and physically.

Coming from a low-income background as a first-generation college graduate, Iâ€™m driven by the desire to break down barriers and defy expectations. I donâ€™t let circumstances define me, and Iâ€™m always seeking to grow beyond the limitations others might expect.

At the core, Iâ€™m a lifelong learner, always looking for new experiences and ways to grow. Each opportunity, whether big or small, is a chance for me to evolve and discover something new. My journey is about staying curious, embracing challenges, and moving forward with a sense of purpose.

## My Past
**Aug 2020 - Feb 2021:** For six months, I gazed at the cosmos through the lens of mathematical derivations and supercomputers while doing cosmology research on Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB).

**Jun 2021 - Aug 2021:** For a summer, I researched galaxies, ate tacos, and dove headfirst into data science. I also operated one of the largest telescopes in the worldâ€”no big deal.

**Sep 2021 - May 2022:** I worked at a mock startup, exploring NLP in practical settings with the creative freedom to build machine learning models however I saw fit. It was like a playground for algorithms.

**Oct 2021 - Mar 2023:** My largest project to date: using NLP in human rights research. I worked on every part of the data pipeline, from collecting and translating Korean financial documents to waiting days for processes to finish (or not). I also gave presentations and wrote a 10-page reportâ€”very official.

**May 2022 - Aug 2022:** I spent a summer in sunny California as a data analyst intern, played ping pong, hiked a lot, and created over 50 graphs that should save the company a lot of money.

**Oct 2023 - Jul 2024:** I worked at a hedge fund with around $100 million under management, applying machine learning to develop reinforcement learning trading strategies (robots playing with money). I made sure that money moved fastâ€”and without any hiccups.

## My Present
As of October 2024, I am currently looking for a new job (sadly:( my last company shut down) and building a website for my photography.

## My Future
If I knew what my future held, I'd sure be a hell of a lot happier.
