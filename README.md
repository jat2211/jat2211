### Hi there, I'm Jay! 👋

- 🎨 I’m currently working on some digital art projects. Check out some prelimary work [here](https://github.com/jat2211/Warhol-and-Convolutional-Neural-Network) for neural network art! Also, my [pixel art](https://github.com/jat2211/pixelart):)
- 🔭 I recently completed an astronomy research internship modeling galaxies. All of my work can be found right [here](https://github.com/jat2211/Photoionization-Modeling).
- 💸 Right now, I'm fighting for the people using [NLP](https://github.com/jat2211/data-for-good) to find human rights violations by companies in 10-Ks and also work as a data engineer at a startup!
- 📝 I’m currently learning C and systems programming.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any data science projects so shoot me an email at jay.trevino@columbia.edu!

If you're here from my website, then happy to have you! Otherwise, you should go check it out using this [link](https://jat2211.github.io/home/). It's not a virus, I promise. In the future, I'll be hosting a new website on Notion (it's already in the works) as I love the customizability and hope to showcase personal content and projects.
